xcb-proto (0.9.92-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  
  [ Josh Triplett ]
  * No longer installs files to /usr/include/X11, so remove Pre-Depends on
    x11-common.
  * Update to Standards-Version 3.7.2 (no changes required).
  * Point specifically to http://xcb.freedesktop.org/dist in copyright file,
    rather than http://xcb.freedesktop.org .
  * Add debian/watch file.
  * Drop Depends line, which only contained empty substitution variables.
  * Add debian/xcb-proto.install, to install the pkgconfig file to /usr/share
    rather than /usr/lib.  Add DEB_DH_INSTALL_SOURCEDIR and DEB_DESTDIR to
    debian/rules, pointing to debian/tmp, to allow use of dh_install for
    renaming files.
